# Decimal Developement v2 
So actually yeah this is my new website of my developement, you can even fork and make changes to it. 
The old website codes also available. You can view it by clicking it [here](https://github.com/Scientific-Guy/decimaldev-old)

This website css is half dependent on Bootstrap 4 and FontAwesome

This website has following features
- [Guides](https://decimaldev.repl.co/guides)
- [Api for guides](https://decimaldev.repl.co/guides/decimal-guides-api)

Thats all features lel. I will add more in future.
And yes its hosted in **repl.it**.
Currently i am the only guy(Science Spot) who runs this developement ;)

If any issues report it in issues tab.
You also join our Discord Server by clicking [here](https://discord.gg/FrduEZd)

And very most you can also post guides promoting your NPM package or anything. Do a pull request by updating the `/guides/guides.json`. I will review and add to the website which seems silly but Ok...
